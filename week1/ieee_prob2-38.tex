\section{Introduction}
We are asked to solve Problem 2--37 of the main textbook~\cite{Spong2006}. Here,
a robot is near a table, with a camera placed over the table to supervise the
robot. A cube is also placed in the center of the table-top. 
The objective of the problem is to express all the frames in the environment
(frame for the edge of the table, frame for the cube,
and frame for the overhead camera) in terms of the homogeneous transformations with
respect to the base frame, situated at the base link of the robot. An additional
objective of the problem is to find the homogeneous transformation relating
the center of the cube's frame to the camera's frame. The graphic below, given
in the textbook, gives a pictorial representation of the problem.

\section{Materials and Methods}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.
