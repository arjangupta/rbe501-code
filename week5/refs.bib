   abstract = {Background: Lung cancer is usually suspected in individuals who have an abnormal chest radiograph or have symptoms caused by either local or systemic effects of the tumor. The method of diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the type of lung cancer (small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), the size and location of the primary tumor, the presence of metastasis, and the overall clinical status of the patient. The objective of this study was to determine the test performance characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer. Methods: To update previous recommendations on techniques available for the initial diagnosis of lung cancer, a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Healthstar, and Cochrane Library databases covering material to July 2011 and print bibliographies was performed to identify studies comparing the results of sputum cytology, conventional bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy (FB), electromagnetic navigation (EMN) bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS)-guided lung biopsy, transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) or biopsy, pleural fluid cytology, and pleural biopsy with histologic reference standard diagnoses among at least 50 patients with suspected lung cancer. Recommendations were developed by the writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see the article "Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer" in this guideline), and reviewed by all members of the Lung Cancer Guideline Panel prior to approval by the Thoracic Oncology NetWork, the Guidelines Oversight Committee, and the Board of Regents of the American College of Chest Physicians. Results: Sputum cytology is an acceptable method of establishing the diagnosis of lung cancer, with a pooled sensitivity rate of 66% and a specificity rate of 99%. However, the sensitivity of sputum cytology varies according to the location of the lung cancer. For central, endobronchial lesions, the overall sensitivity of FB for diagnosing lung cancer is 88%. The diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy decreases for peripheral lesions. Peripheral lesions < 2 or > 2 cm in diameter showed a sensitivity of 34% and 63%, respectively. R-EBUS and EMN are emerging technologies for the diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer, with diagnostic yields of 73% and 71%, respectively. The pooled sensitivity of TTNA for the diagnosis of lung cancer was 90%. A trend toward lower sensitivity was noted for lesions < 2 cm in diameter. TTNA is associated with a higher rate of pneumothorax compared with bronchoscopic procedures. In a patient with a malignant pleural effusion, pleural fluid cytology is reported to have a mean sensitivity of about 72%. A definitive diagnosis of metastatic disease to the pleural space can be estalished with a pleural biopsy. The diagnostic yield for closed pleural biopsy ranges from 38% to 47% and from 75% to 88% for image-guided closed biopsy. Thoracoscopic biopsy of the pleura carries the highest diagnostic yield, 95% to 97%. The accuracy in differentiating between small cell and non-small cell cytology for the various diagnostic modalities was 98%, with individual studies ranging from 94% to 100%. The average false-positive and false-negative rates were 9% and 2%, respectively. Although the distinction between small cell and NSCLC by cytology appears to be accurate, NSCLCs are clinically, pathologically, and molecularly heterogeneous tumors. In the past decade, clinical trials have shown us that NSCLCs respond to different therapeutic agents based on histologic phenotypes and molecular characteristics. The physician performing diagnostic procedures on a patient suspected of having lung cancer must ensure that adequate tissue is acquired to perform accurate histologic and molecular characterization of NSCLCs. Conclusions: The sensitivity of bronchoscopy is high for endobronchial disease and poor for peripheral lesions < 2 cm in diameter. The sensitivity of TTNA is excellent for malignant disease, but TTNA has a higher rate of pneumothorax than do bronchoscopic modalities. R-EBUS and EMN bronchoscopy show potential for increasing the diagnostic yield of FB for peripheral lung cancers. Thoracoscopic biopsy of the pleura has the highest diagnostic yield for diagnosis of metastatic pleural effusion in a patient with lung cancer. Adequate tissue acquisition for histologic and molecular characterization of NSCLCs is paramount. Copyright © by the American College of Chest Physicians 2013.},

   abstract = {Background: The detection of pulmonary nodules (PNs) is likely to increase, especially with the release of the National Lung Screen Trials. When tissue diagnosis is desired, transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) is recommended. Several guided-bronchoscopy technologies have been developed to improve the yield of transbronchial biopsy for PN diagnosis: electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB ), virtual bronchoscopy (VB), radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), ultrathin bronchoscope, and guide sheath. We undertook this meta-analysis to determine the overall diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopy using one or a combination of the modalities described here. Methods: We performed a MEDLINE search using "bronchoscopy" and "solitary pulmonary nodule." Studies evaluating the diagnostic yield of ENB, VB, R-EBUS, ultrathin bronchoscope, and/or guide sheath for peripheral nodules were included. The overall diagnostic yield and yield based on size were extracted. Adverse events, if reported, were recorded. Meta-analysis techniques incorporating inverse variance weighting and a random-effects meta-analysis approach were used. Results: A total of 3,052 lesions from 39 studies were included. The pooled diagnostic yield was 70%, which is higher than the yield for traditional transbronchial biopsy. The yield increased as the lesion size increased. The pneumothorax rate was 1.5%, which is significantly smaller than that reported for TTNA. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic techniques is better than that of traditional transbronchial biopsy. Although the yield remains lower than that of TTNA, the procedural risk is lower. Guided bronchoscopy may be an alternative or be complementary to TTNA for tissue sampling of PN, but further study is needed to determine its role in the evaluation of peripheral pulmonary lesions. © 2012 American College of Chest Physicians.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Advanced bronchoscopy techniques such as electromagnetic navigation (EMN) have been studied in clinical trials, but there are no randomized studies comparing EMN with standard bronchoscopy. Objectives: To measure and identify the determinants of diagnostic yield for bronchoscopy in patients with peripheral lung lesions. Secondary outcomes included diagnostic yield of different sampling techniques, complications, and practice pattern variations. Methods: We used the AQuIRE (ACCP Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education) registry to conduct a multicenter study of consecutive patients who underwent transbronchial biopsy (TBBx) for evaluation of peripheral lesions. Measurements and Main Results: Fifteen centers with 22 physicians enrolled 581 patients. Of the 581 patients, 312 (53.7%) had a diagnostic bronchoscopy. Unadjusted for other factors, the diagnostic yield was 63.7% when no radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-EBUS) and no EMN were used, 57.0% with r-EBUS alone, 38.5%withEMNalone, and 47.1%withEMNcombinedwith r-EBUS. In multivariate analysis, peripheral transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), larger lesion size, nonupper lobe location, and tobacco use were associated with increased diagnostic yield, whereas EMN was associated with lower diagnostic yield. Peripheral TBNA was used in 16.4% of cases. TBNA was diagnostic, whereas TBBx was nondiagnostic in 9.5% of cases in which both were performed. Complications occurred in 13 (2.2%) patients, and pneumothorax occurred in 10 (1.7%) patients. There were significant differences between centers and physicians in terms of case selection, sampling methods, and anesthesia.Medical center diagnostic yields ranged from 33 to 73% (P = 0.16). Conclusions: Peripheral TBNA improved diagnostic yield for peripheral lesions but was underused. The diagnostic yields of EMN and r-EBUS were lower than expected, even after adjustment.},

   abstract = {Capsule endoscopy for the colon was introduced to allow an alternative screening method to the invasive classic colonoscopy. The results of initial studies have shown inferior detection rates of colonic polyps by the colon capsule. In this paper we aim to review and summarize the recent advances in wireless capsule endoscopy of the colon. Publications regarding the use of colon capsule with new technology, as well as personal experience, were reviewed. Since the introduction of the first generation of the colon capsule, many improvements have been made to create a better capsule endoscope. These include a wider angle of view, a faster adaptable frame rate and a new data recorder which is able to control the capsule activity during the transit through the bowel. Recent studies show these improvements had a direct effect on the colon capsule performance, leading to a better diagnostic yield. Recent advancements in the technology of the wireless colon capsule endoscope offer the option to screen patients for colonic polyps noninvasively. Colon capsule endoscopy may become relevant for assessment of extent of inflammatory bowel disease. © 2011, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background and study aims: Capsule endoscopy (Pillcam Colon) has recently shown acceptable accuracy in detecting colonic lesions when compared with colonoscopy. The aim of this analysis is to provide a model to assess the cost and effectiveness of population-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using capsule endoscopy and to compare the cost-effectiveness with that of a colonoscopy screening program. Methods: The cost-effectiveness of two screening strategies using colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy were compared by a computer model based on a Markov process. In this model, a hypothetical population of 100 000 individuals aged 50 years and over, undergoes a 10 yearly screening procedure. Different thresholds for postcapsule polypectomy referral were simulated. Results: At baseline, the incremental cost-effectiveness (compared with no screening) of colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy was $ 16165 and $ 29244 per life-year saved, respectively. When equal compliance was simulated, the colonoscopy program was more effective and less costly than a strategy based on capsule endoscopy. When simulating an initial compliance to capsule endoscopy 30% better than colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy became the more effective and more cost-effective option. A 20% better compliance was sufficient when a higher accuracy of capsule endoscopy for polyps was assumed. A 6 mm threshold for polypectomy referral was associated with a substantial cost reduction in the capsule endoscopy program with only a small loss of efficacy. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of capsule endoscopy depends mainly on its ability to improve compliance to CRC screening. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Background: Physicians play a critical role in healthcare delivery. With an aging US population, population growth, and a greater insured population following the Affordable Care Act (ACA), healthcare demand is growing at an unprecedented pace. This study is to examine current and future physician job surplus/shortage trends across the United States of America from 2017 to 2030. Methods: Using projected changes in population size and age, the authors developed demand and supply models to forecast the physician shortage (difference between demand and supply) in each of the 50 states. Letter grades were then assigned based on projected physician shortage ratios (physician shortage per 100 000 people) to evaluate physician shortages and describe the changing physician workforce in each state. Results: On the basis of current trends, the number of states receiving a grade of "D" or "F" for their physician shortage ratio will increase from 4 in 2017 to 23 by 2030, with a total national deficit of 139 160 physician jobs. By 2030, the West is forecasted to have the greatest physician shortage ratio (69 physician jobs per 100 000 people), while the Northeast will have a surplus of 50 jobs per 100 000 people. Conclusion: There will be physician workforce shortages throughout the country in 2030. Outcomes of this study provide a foundation to discuss effective and efficient ways to curb the worsening shortage over the coming decades and meet current and future population demands.
